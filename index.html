  <section id="abstract">
    Web components allow you to create encapsulated custom elements on the web
    platform, but how can you make sure that those elements actually follow
    common guidelines in such a way that useful elements fit in well with the
    rest of the platform? The TAG believes this is important so that users
    don’t feel like they are dealing with mismatched APIs and also a
    requirement if any of these elements were to end up in the HTML standard.

    ## Common patterns

    The web platform is not known for being 100% consistent, but there are
    definitely some recognizable patterns across the platform, such as with regard
    to naming. Try to stay consistent with what is already used, like if other
    elements use “selected” as an attribute for the same behavior, there is
    no reason to start using something else (say, “chosen” or “marked”).

    ### Native HTML elements

    In order to answer that, we need to look how native elements work, and
    what defines them:

    1. **Elements don’t throw errors when used declaratively**. Native elements
    don’t throw errors during construction or using regular DOM interactions.

      > For example, they don’t strictly enforce their content model. You can
      easily add a `div` element inside an `img` element, and even if that means 
      it won’t render or behave properly, it should never throw.

    2. **Elements are self-contained**. Elements come as part of the web platform
    and thus will work without requiring any other libraries.

      * Make sure your element is self-contained and ships with all its dependencies.
      * Are all paths relative to required resources (images, etc.) relative to the component source?
      * The elements don't depend on anything else (or any other element) being loaded beforehand.

    3. **Use events to pass data to the outside world**. All custom elements
    inherit from EventTarget, and thus events can be used to pass data along,
    but please follow the guidelines in the
    [DOM Living Standard §2.11](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#action-versus-occurance). See also
    the TAG’s guidance on [event design](https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/#event-design).

      * One way to structure your elements for usability is the "data down, events up" flow
      pattern, e.g. sending data down the DOM tree by setting properties/attributes on elements,
      and dispatching events, which bubble up the tree.

    4. **Use attributes to receive non-complex data**. Elements are configured
    declaratively as much as possible, which allows them to be used
    declaratively, as well as work great with template bindings.

       There are a few things to keep in mind though
       * Use boolean attributes for boolean values, i.e.
       `<my-element selected></my-element>` instead of
       `<my-element selected="true"></my-element>`.
       * Don’t use custom attributes for styling, like `bgcolor`.
         Instead use [Custom Properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables-1)
         or [CSS Shadow Parts](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-shadow-parts-1).
       * If elements accept complex data such as objects, arrays or streams,
         create a JavaScript API to deal with these.

    5. **Interactive elements are focusable**, and can be interacted with
    using a keyboard in addition to mouse/touch. Generally, make sure that
    elements are accessible.

    6. **Elements can be instantiated without being part of the document**.
    Elements can be created from scripts etc. before being inserted into 
    the document, so don’t assume that document APIs such as `parentNode` will 
    be available before `connectedCallback`.

    7. **Elements should only have basic styling**. Native elements are
    implementable by multiple browsers on multiple platforms, so they have
    only generic styling out of the box. Theming of the element might be
    desired, but should be separated out from the essential style of the
    element (and made extensible). Create the simplest style possible—at
    least as basic as, if not more than, existing standard elements. We can
    call this functional styling in contrast to “theme”-like styling.

      It would not be appropriate to encode a specific UI styling, such as
    Material Design (Google) or Cupertino (Apple), into the element.

      It is appropriate to create styling hooks to allow elements to be
    themed to match popular styles, such as Material and Cupertino.

    ### Other considerations

    Apart from following the properties of native elements, there are a
    lot of other ways to make an element fit well with the web platform.

    1. **Don’t enforce unnecessary child/parent relationships**. Even
    though your element is intended to be used in conjunction with another
    element, attempt to make it work as a child of any other element, if
    that makes sense.

    2. **Avoid using callbacks**. Refer to TAGs guidance on
    [promises](https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/#promises).

    3. **Harmonize declarative (HTML) and imperative (JavaScript) APIs**.

        Attributes (HTML) form (part of) your declarative API; your prototype
        defines your imperative (JavaScript) API. Try to keep the analogous
        parts linked whenever possible so a user can modify either to the
        same effect. (e.g. `<my-element opened>` or `this.opened = true`).

        Elements can store values set via attributes or imperative APIs in
        the attribute itself, or in the JavaScript property or elsewhere,
        but should be consistent. Come up with a plan for state management
        and stick to it consistently.

       <aside class="note">
         Browsers are internally lazy. They do not store data in
         either attributes or properties, casting to JS or attribute strings
         as needed (and not before). Current Web Component practice forces
         developers into a choice without this set of tools. This can create
         timing issues if you choose properties as the source-of-truth, or
         high-cost conversions if you pick attributes. This is a messy choice,
         and one your elements will need to navigate to balance performance
         and consistency.
       </aside>

       <aside class="note">
         Synchronizing boolean attributes is about the presence of
         the attribute, so testing with hasAttribute is recommended.
       </aside>

       Custom elements have the requirement that they need to contain a
       hyphen (-) in their name. That is important, as it means that we
       can standardize elements by never allowing a hyphen - in that way,
       there will be no name clash.

       <aside class="note">
         Current native element don’t support named slots. Though
       shadow DOM allows you to use named slots for your light DOM, there
       is currently no precedent for this with native elements. This might
       change in the future.
